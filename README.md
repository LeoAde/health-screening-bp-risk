## ðŸ“Š Data
- Dataset: anonymized health screening data  
- Cleaned file: `Health_Screening_Final.csv`  
- Rows after cleaning: ~[fill in number]  
- Columns: [fill in number]

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Fixed delimiter issues and standardized column types  
- Enforced valid ranges:
  - **Systolic BP:** 70â€“250 mmHg  
  - **Diastolic BP:** 40â€“150 mmHg  
- Removed **1,206 outliers (~1.7%)** (negative or extreme values)  
- Converted **AgeDays â†’ Age (years)** and dropped redundant columns  
- Confirmed cleaning did not bias results (p-value > 0.05)

## ðŸ”‘ Insights
- **Weight vs Blood Pressure:** Heavier people show higher systolic BP, especially those with cardiovascular disease.  
- **Age vs Blood Pressure:** BP increases with age, with older groups crossing the **130 mmHg hypertension threshold**.  
- **BMI Category vs Disease:** Obese and overweight groups have the **highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease**.
